 > Using a file to store inputted quotes with hanging frame style 

This is a Python program that writes multiple lines of text into a text file named `mylife.txt`. The user is prompted to enter more lines of text until they decide to stop

**See sample output:**
```
Enter line: Adventure awaits, go explore today.
Are there more lines y/n? y
Enter line: Explicit is better than implicit.
Are there more lines y/n? y
Enter line: Simple is better than complex.
Are there more lines y/n? n
```
Then the program displays their input in the said file in a format that resembles a hanging frame on a wall (see `myliufe.txt` for a demonstration).
